When it comes to design planning, the approach is simple, There should be separate controller files for different entitites
and all the different controllers should be using a common context file called api_context.ex in such a way that a typical API will follow this path
router.ex -> respective controller file -> api_context.ex -> respective_controller -> respective view. 

This approach helped me to handle all the cases with ease and also design API's in a quick fashion.
