The following API's were developed in this project.

Before using any API, it is important to register a user and generate a jwt which should be passed in every subsequent request
We can also use existing users which can be migrated using seeds.exs
-> User can be registered using the API (Post) "/sign_up/"
-> It expects body in the following format 
    %{
            email
            password
            fullName
            age
        }
    It returns a JSON response in the following format 
    %{
            email
            password
            fullName
            age
            inserted_at
            updated_at
        }
    Password is stored in the form of hash value in the database

Once the user is registered, we can login the user using the following API (Post) "/login/"
-> It expects an input in the following format 
    {
        user {
            email
            password
        }
    }

    It uses elixir library guardian for authentication and creating session data. 
    Once the user is authenticated, it generates a JWT which is valid for 1 day. 
    We need to pass this JWT in every request as a header "jwt_token". The token would be then validated and necessary actin wouldbe performed

(Get) "/api/v1/get_all_users/"
This API returns a list of all the users in the users table
Header ->
     jwt_token: JWT token of authentication
     content-type: application/json

It returns a list of JSON structure and every JSON struct has the following structure
    %{
            fullName
            email
            age
            id
            password
            topicsOfInterest {
                topicName
                shortDesc
            }
        }

(Get) "api/v1/get_all_topics/" 
This API returns a list of all the topics in the topics_of_interest resource
Header ->
     jwt_token: JWT token of authentication
     content-type: application/json
It returns a list of JSON structure and every JSON struct has the following structure
    %{
        topicName
        shortDesc
    }

(PUT) "api/v1/update_user/"
This API updates a user record in the users resource
Header ->
     jwt_token: JWT token of authentication
     content-type: application/json
Body -> %{
            email
            password
            age
            fullName
        }
It returns a String respons ewith status code 200 if the user record was updated successfully

(DELETE) "/api/v1/delete_user"
This API deletes a user from the users table
Header ->
     jwt_token: JWT token of authentication
     content-type: application/json
Body -> emailId: email id of the user which has to be deleted
It returns a String respons ewith status code 200 if the user record was updated successfully

(POST)
